# LightOJ Problem Templates
This repository contains solution templates for LightOJ volume problems.

### Contribution Guideline
This whole project is based on voluntary contribution. You are more than welcome to contribute. If you think you can write a template for a problem, please create
an issue first like this: https://github.com/lightoj-dev/problem-templates/issues/1 and then assign yourself. This will make sure no other person is working on the same problem's template for the same languages. Then add your tutorial by a pull request like this: https://github.com/lightoj-dev/problem-templates/pull/3. If you don't know how to create pull request, read this article: https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github

We are planning to have solution templates for all possible languages. But you don't need to work on all, write any langauge you are familiar with.

Each problem will have its own folder with the name of its problem id, such as 1000, 1214. Each folder will contain templates such as:

```
bash.sh
c.c
clojure.clj
cpp.cpp
cpp14.cpp
cpp17.cpp
csharp.cs
dart.dart
elixir.exs
erlang.erl
go.go
groovy.groovy
haskell.hs
java.java
scala.scala
javascript.js
kotlin.kt
lisp.lisp
lua.lua
objectivec.mm
pascal.pas
perl.pl
php.php
python3.py
r.r
ruby.rb
rust.rs
scala.scala
sql.sql
swift.swift
visualbasic.vb

```

Each tempale should simplify the input and output. But should not give away any solution hints. Please properly indent your code, also add comments on your code to make code more readable to problem solvers.

Looking forward to have your contribution.
